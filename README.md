<h1 align="center">Pokedex</h1>
<p align="center">  
Pokedex is a small demo application based on modern Android application tech-stacks and MVVM architecture.<br>This project is for focusing especially on the new library Dagger-Hilt of implementing dependency injection.<br>
Also fetching data from the network and integrating persisted data in the database via repository pattern.

## Tech stack & Open-source libraries
- Minimum SDK level 21
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) based + [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) for asynchronous.
- Dagger-Hilt (alpha) for dependency injection.
- JetPack
  - LiveData - notify domain layer data to views.
  - Lifecycle - dispose of observing data when lifecycle state changes.
  - ViewModel - UI related data holder, lifecycle aware.
  - Room Persistence - construct a database using the abstract layer.
- Architecture
  - MVVM Architecture (View - DataBinding - ViewModel - Model)
  - Repository pattern
- [Retrofit2 & OkHttp3](https://github.com/square/retrofit) - construct the REST APIs and paging network data.
- [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi/) - A modern JSON library for Kotlin and Java.
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide), [GlidePalette](https://github.com/florent37/GlidePalette) - loading images.
- [TransformationLayout](https://github.com/zeynelerdi/transformationlayout) - implementing transformation motion animations.
- [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) - logging.
- [Material-Components](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android) - Material design components like ripple animation, cardView.


## Architecture
Pokedex is based on MVVM architecture and a repository pattern.

Pokedex using the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) for constructing RESTful API.<br>
PokeAPI provides a RESTful API interface to highly detailed objects built from thousands of lines of data related to Pokémon.
